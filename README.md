Mobile Apps Coursework project

The MyMediCare android app aims to allow users to track their health by allowing users to log their temperature, blood pressure and heart rate. 
  The app will be able to assess their health and notify them of any health risks. 
  The app will also notify their GP if the risk is severe enough. 
  This app will need to be used by the elderly and infirmed, who need a convenient and easy to understand method of tracking their health. 

  This prototype features limited functionality. The prototype is unable to store records, access phone contacts and send SMS messages.
